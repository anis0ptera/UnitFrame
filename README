I have attached a zip file which contains my deliverables for the challenge.

Manifest:
UnitFrame.py - automation code
fandor-test-cases.xls - test case listing

1. Automated tests are written in Python using the Selenium library. unittest is used as the framework.
2. Both automated and manual tests focus on controls; simple text elements are out-of-scope for integration and regression.
3. Most of the automated tests are one-offs, but the last couple of tests show an approach of iterating through multiple links.  This approach would make up a greater percentage of a complete test of this page.
4. Manual Vs. Automated indicates whether the test case is automated or not. Most of these cases could be automated with the possible exception of some of the player ones.
5. A lot of the automation is based on text elements; IDs would be preferable.  Not many IDs were observed in the code.  At Monitise we recommended that IDs be added to the application code and developers took our recomendation.
6. Suite and test case handling is deferred; a simple calling statement executes all cases.

Run from DOS command line:

C:>UnitFrame.py

or:

C:>python UnitFrame.py
